JAVASCRIPT 1

variables:
let - changeable
const - not changeable
var - is an old way of declaring variables, similar to let, not used anymore tbh

each browser tab has its own execution environment, that means that code in one tab cannot directly affect another tab. It's a security measure.
(there are ways of send code and data between different website/tabs safely but they are more advanced)

Js code is run from top to bottom, so erros like "Cannot acces "xyz" before initialization" can occur 

Interpreted vs compiled code:
Interpreted: runs from top to bottom, just as it's written. The results are immediately returned.
Compiled: is transfered into different code before running - machine code, binary, therefore they're faster
Js is using just-in-time compiling -> the code is compiled to binary while the scrip is being used, but it's stil called a interpereted language, since the compilation happens at run time, not beforehand

Server-side vs client-side code:
client: code that is run on client's computer. The code is downloaded and runned in user's browser
server: code is run on server and only the results are downloaded and displayed in the browser

dynamic code/website means that it has ability to change the content on the website, or for backend - generate new data and send for front end code to display
Static websites are websites that show the same stuff all the time

Adding inline js to html is a bad practise. Better to use eventListeners

FLEX-DIRECTION

main cross axes:
if flex-direction: row main = left-right | cross = top-bottom | flex-basis is width 
if flex-directoin: column main = top-bottom | cross = left-right | flex-basis is height

Moving content around: 
justify-content : MAIN axis 
align-items: CROSS axis

content: is a group of items and is aligned to the MAIN axis - warzywa na szaszłyku
items are individual, they can be moved seperately across CROSS axis - winogrona nabite na wykałaczki leżące w misce
so,
justify = main axis
align = cross axis
&
align-self: usable for only one child

HYPOTHETICAL SIZE IN FLEXBOX

when using flow layout width and height are a hard constrain, but.
For flexbox, width of the item is just a suggestion, because the container is what allows child to exist, so even with a specified width - it could be smaller

MINIMAL SIZE

A child item wont shrink below it's minimum size, rather it will overflow the container
to prevent the overlaping, we can use min-width:0 on child item, which basically means "shrink as much as you need its too late to show you all"
But you need to use it with care, there's a great reward and risk, especially with text, especially with long words


WRAPPING
normally item wont wrap, they will shrin, with /flex-wrap: 1;/, they will rather wrap to another line, before shrinking from its hypothetical size

Now,
align-items still works the cross axis, but every row is a small flexbox of it's own

To align all the rows inside the container:
align-content - works like align-items but with whole content instead of one item
